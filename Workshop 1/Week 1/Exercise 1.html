        <p><Font size="4">Thomas John Watson Sr. (February 17, 1874 – June 19, 1956) was an American businessman who served as the chairman and CEO of IBM.
        He oversaw the company's growth into an international force from 1914 to 1956. Watson developed IBM's management style and corporate
        culture from John Henry Patterson's training at NCR. He turned the company into a highly effective selling organization, based 
       largely on punched card tabulating machines. A leading self-made industrialist, he was one of the richest men of his time and was 
       called the world's greatest salesman when he died in 1956.</Font></p>

        He built a worldwide industry during his 42 years at IBM. Mr. Watson was born in Campbell, N.Y., February 17, 1874.Watson was an 
        influential American psychologist whose most famous work occurred during the early 20th century at Johns Hopkins University. Watson 
        conducted research on animal behavior, child-rearing, and advertising. Along with this research, he conducted the controversial 
        “Little Albert” study.In 1943 Thomas Watson, chairman of IBM, said, "I think there's a world market for maybe five computers." With 
        that kind of thinking, no one paid much attention in 1952 when a British scientist named Dummar wrote: It seems now possible to 
        envisage electronic equipment in a solid block with no connecting wires.</Font></p>
